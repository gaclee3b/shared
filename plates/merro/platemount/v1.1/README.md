# General Info
This plate-mount plate file was designed to accomodate the lfn.merro60 requirements.
The lfn.merro60 requires certain non-standard features:
- access to the pcb-top-side jst port
- access to the pcb-top-side reset button under the spacebar
- plate-mount stabilizers due to lack of pcb-mount holes available on the lfn.merro60 2mm substrate

These requirements are fulfilled by:
- large opening on the plate between the tab and Q
- small opening above the reset button under the spacebar
- plate-mount stabilizer cutouts (the provided plate assumes split bs, full l-shift, split r-shift, ansi enter, 7u tsangan bottom)

# Misc Notes
Typical spacebar-length stabilizer cutouts are removed. I was able to insert and assemble a tx ap platemount spacebar stabilizer
by inserting the housing from below and slipping it into place from above the plate. No need to remove wire. This was done on an
fr4 plate. Other materials may have smaller tolerances for allowing the same assembly method and might require a return to the
traditional plate-mount stabilizer installation approach with the spacebar-lenght stabilizer cutouts on the plate.

# DIYers
The zip file in the gerbers directory should have all files needed for a manufacturer to make the same plate.
